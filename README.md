# Hosting XML
This is a test repository for hosting xml, xsd and xsl as a webpage. 

It uses prototype schemas based on the work for HQM data exchanges used in HQM assessments.

The following xml file is a hypothetical merged file containing 4 out of 36 issues that assessment information has been entered for. The xsl file transforms the data to compare discrepancies from a project perspective.
